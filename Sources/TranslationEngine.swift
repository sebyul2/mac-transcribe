/// Live translation for locked (interpreter) sessions.
///
/// ## Algorithm
///
/// Two published techniques, composed:
///
///  * **Re-translation** (Arivazhagan et al., 2020 — the approach Google's
///    streaming translation shipped): each request translates one whole
///    utterance from scratch. Requests are *stateless*, so a slow or lost
///    response can never corrupt state — a newer response simply supersedes
///    it. Because at most one request per slot is ever in flight, source
///    growth while a request runs is naturally *conflated*: the next request
///    picks up the latest text, and the request rate self-paces to the
///    model's latency.
///
///  * **Local agreement** (Liu et al., 2020), trailing word masked: the
///    prefix on which two consecutive hypotheses agree is committed (rendered
///    white); the rest stays draft (dimmed). Commitment is monotonic within
///    an utterance, so a committed word never flickers back.
///
/// ## Model
///
/// The transcriber emits one utterance per line and only ever appends (a
/// pause seals the current line; see LongFormTranscriber). So the engine
/// holds an append-only array of `Utterance`, each with a stable `id`. The
/// last one may be *live* (still being spoken); the rest are *sealed*.
///
/// A single representation carries every state. Translation quality is a
/// value, not a scatter of flags:
///
///   - `.none`  — not translated yet → the caption shows the SOURCE text in
///     grey, so a slow, rate-limited, or offline LLM never blanks out speech.
///   - `.draft` — a live hypothesis (or a sealed line still awaiting its
///     quality pass); split white/grey at the agreement point.
///   - `.final` — the definitive, whole-sentence translation; fully white.
///
/// Sealing needs no copying: a live utterance simply flips `sealed = true`
/// and keeps whatever `.draft` it had — that draft *is* the provisional
/// translation. The quality pass later upgrades it to `.final`.
///
/// ## Requests
///
/// Two slots run concurrently, each holding the id it is translating:
///
///   - **live**   — keeps the spoken line current (fragment prompt, zero
///     reasoning effort, reuses the prior hypothesis for prefix stability).
///   - **quality** — upgrades the newest sealed lines to `.final` (whole
///     sentence, low reasoning effort, no reuse chain — this is where
///     translation quality comes from). Lines that scroll out of the caption
///     window before their turn are abandoned, not queued: translating
///     speech nobody can see only delays the words they can.
///
/// A shared circuit breaker stops issuing requests after a run of failures
/// and resumes after a cooldown; captions fall back to source meanwhile.
///
/// Single-threaded (main). LLM completions bounce back to main. No locks.
